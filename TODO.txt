Moving selected shapes with arrow keys(like resizing)
Cut duplicate save code for ellipse/rectangle now that they both implement IDrawableRectangle
Double check that my use of OnEventHandler is correct. It might make more sense to just bind to the event as a handler.

Undo (CTRL+Z)
Move some canvas specific key handling from global to canvas. Also, check how much of the SelectablePanel class is even required.
Find a tidy/centralised way to manage all the Canvas.Invalidate() calls.

After that, I think I will consider this project completed. Perhaps refactor the code to use some design patterns that I have learned from HFDP?
